I have been trying to blog for a little while, but ive only ever made blog posts like maybe once a year: [old blog](https://nebs-corner.blogspot.com/)

I have been wanting a new outlet for blogging cuz i really dont like blogger and I already spend a lot of my time writing markdown for various docs for things so I wanted a place that I could just be free to let myself continue rambling about shit.

Lately I have been working as an ECE Master's student at the Georgia Institute of Technology on many different projects ranging from learning out to train dogs in class to making race cars go fast at [HyTech Racing](https://hytechracing.gatech.edu/). 

I have a lot of goals this semester and even more projects that I want to talk about and share the stuff ive been doing for both my own benefit down the line as well as for other to yoink from my github and use in their shit. 

I may also turn some of these posts into a thesis or integrate them into project reports and this blog may serve as the testing ground for some of that content.
