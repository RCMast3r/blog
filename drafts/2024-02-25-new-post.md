[data acquisition presentation](https://rcmast3r.github.io/data_acq_presentation/)

- motivation:
    - at competition it was tough to diagnose an issue with a pedal sensor that went wrong
    - issues with architecture of data acquisition

- ideas for approaches:
    - dbc files
    - mcap files
    - protobuf msgs

- data acquisition at the higher level
    - end goal being that we have an infrastructure that we don't have to touch and grows with the car over time.
    - long term database
        - creating a database for car data that doesn't rely on a fixed set of underlying data types
